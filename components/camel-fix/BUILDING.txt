This module depends on some private jars in the IONA internal repository so its only intended to be
built by folks at IONA.

To enable your maven to be able to download from the internal Maven repo you need to edit your file at

  ~/.m2/settings.xml


And make sure there's some entry like the following - changing myUserName and myPassword to your actual settings


<?xml version="1.0"?>
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>open.iona.m2-internal</id>
      <username>myUserName</username>
      <password>myPassword</password>
    </server>
    ...
