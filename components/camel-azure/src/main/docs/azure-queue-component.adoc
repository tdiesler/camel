== Azure Storage Queue Service Component

*Available as of Camel version 2.19*

The Azure Queue component supports storing and retrieving the messages to/from
https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/queues/[Azure Storage Queue] service.

Prerequisites

You must have a valid Windows Azure Storage account. More information is available at
https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/[Azure Documentation Portal].

### URI Format

[source,java]
------------------------------
azure-queue://accountName/queueName[?options]
------------------------------

The queue will be created if it does not already exist. +
 You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

For example in order to get a message content from the queue `messageQueue` 
in the `camelazure` storage account and, use the following snippet:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("azure-queue:/camelazure/messageQueue").
to("file://queuedirectory");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### URI Options


// component options: START
The Azure Storage Queue Service component has no options.
// component options: END











// endpoint options: START
The Azure Storage Queue Service endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
azure-queue:containerAndQueueUri
----

with the following path and query parameters:

==== Path Parameters (1 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *containerAndQueueUri* | *Required* Container Queue compact Uri |  | String
|===


==== Query Parameters (27 parameters):


[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *azureQueueClient* (common) | The queue service client |  | CloudQueue
| *credentials* (common) | Set the storage credentials, required in most cases |  | StorageCredentials
| *credentialsAccountKey* (common) | Set the storage account key used during authentication phase |  | String
| *credentialsAccountName* (common) | Set the storage account name used during authentication phase |  | String
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle* (consumer) | If the polling consumer did not poll any files, you can enable this option to send an empty message (no body) instead. | false | boolean
| *exceptionHandler* (consumer) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this options is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler
| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. |  | ExchangePattern
| *pollStrategy* (consumer) | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. |  | PollingConsumerPoll Strategy
| *messageTimeToLive* (producer) | Message Time To Live in seconds |  | int
| *messageVisibilityDelay* (producer) | Message Visibility Delay in seconds |  | int
| *operation* (producer) | Queue service operation hint to the producer | listQueues | QueueServiceOperations
| *queuePrefix* (producer) | Set a prefix which can be used for listing the queues |  | String
| *synchronous* (advanced) | Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used, or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported). | false | boolean
| *backoffErrorThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent error polls (failed due some error) that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffIdleThreshold* (scheduler) | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick-in. |  | int
| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is happening again. When this option is in use then backoffIdleThreshold and/or backoffErrorThreshold must also be configured. |  | int
| *delay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the next poll. You can also specify time values using units, such as 60s (60 seconds), 5m30s (5 minutes and 30 seconds), and 1h (1 hour). | 500 | long
| *greedy* (scheduler) | If greedy is enabled, then the ScheduledPollConsumer will run immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages. | false | boolean
| *initialDelay* (scheduler) | Milliseconds before the first poll starts. You can also specify time values using units, such as 60s (60 seconds), 5m30s (5 minutes and 30 seconds), and 1h (1 hour). | 1000 | long
| *runLoggingLevel* (scheduler) | The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that. | TRACE | LoggingLevel
| *scheduledExecutorService* (scheduler) | Allows for configuring a custom/shared thread pool to use for the consumer. By default each consumer has its own single threaded thread pool. |  | ScheduledExecutor Service
| *scheduler* (scheduler) | To use a cron scheduler from either camel-spring or camel-quartz2 component | none | ScheduledPollConsumer Scheduler
| *schedulerProperties* (scheduler) | To configure additional properties when using a custom scheduler or any of the Quartz2, Spring based scheduler. |  | Map
| *startScheduler* (scheduler) | Whether the scheduler should be auto started. | true | boolean
| *timeUnit* (scheduler) | Time unit for initialDelay and delay options. | MILLISECONDS | TimeUnit
| *useFixedDelay* (scheduler) | Controls if fixed delay or fixed rate is used. See ScheduledExecutorService in JDK for details. | true | boolean

Required Azure Storage Queue Service component options

You have to provide the containerAndQueue URI  and the credentials.

### Usage

#### Message headers evaluated by the Azure Storage Queue Service producer

[width="100%",cols="10%,10%,80%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Type |Description

#### Message headers set by the Azure Storage Queue Service producer

#### Azure Queue Client configuration

If your Camel Application is running behind a firewall or if you need to
have more control over the Azure Queue Client configuration, you can
create your own instance:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
StorageCredentials credentials = new StorageCredentialsAccountAndKey("camelazure", "thekey");

CloudQueue client = new CloudQueue("camelazure", credentials);

registry.bind("azureQueueClient", client);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and refer to it in your Camel azure-queue component configuration:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from("azure-queue:/camelazure/messageQueue?azureQueueClient=#client")
.to("mock:result");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Dependencies

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml.

*pom.xml*

[source,xml]
---------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-azure</artifactId>
    <version>${camel-version}</version>
</dependency>
---------------------------------------

where `${camel-version`} must be replaced by the actual version of Camel
(2.19.0 or higher).
