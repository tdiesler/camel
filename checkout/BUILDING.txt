The camel-fix and camel-artixds components depend on several ArtixDS jars available in a private Maven repository.
You will need to purchase ArtixDS to gain access to this repo.

To enable your maven to be able to download from the private Maven repo you need to edit your file at

  ~/.m2/settings.xml

And make sure there's some entry like the following - changing myUserName and myPassword to your actual settings

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>open.iona.m2-internal</id>
      <username>myUserName</username>
      <password>myPassword</password>
    </server>
    ...

Also, you will need to build with the additional -Piona profile set.
